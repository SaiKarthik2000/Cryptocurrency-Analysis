# Cryptocurrency-Analysis
Applying different regression models on Cryptocurrency data

The data is from kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/cryptocurrencypricehistory

We have chosen the Bitcoin and Ethereum Cryptocurrency for analysis due to their popularity

The data consists of the following:
1. Date
2. Opening price of the day
3. Closing price of the day
4. Highest price of the day
5. Lowest price of the day
6. Volume of transactions of the day
7. Market capitalization in USD

Here, we didn't treat the data as Time Series since there was an overall increasing trend and wasn't periodic or seasonal.
